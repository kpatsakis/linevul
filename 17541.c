	 * upstream port.  The section says the delays are tPort2PortU1EL and

	 *
	 * The hub chapter, sections 10.4.2.4 and 10.4.2.5 seem to be talking
	 * about the same delays.  Use the maximum delay calculations from those
	 * sections.  For U1, it's tHubPort2PortExitLat, which is 1us max.  For
	 * U2, it's tHubPort2PortExitLat + U2DevExitLat - U1DevExitLat.  I
	 * assume the device exit latencies they are talking about are the hub
	 * exit latencies.

	 * What do we do if the U2 exit latency is less than the U1 exit
	 * latency?  It's possible, although not likely...
