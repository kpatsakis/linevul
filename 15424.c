	 *   started at address shmaddr. It records it's size and then unmaps
	 *   it.
	 * - Then it unmaps all shm vmas that started at shmaddr and that
	 *   are within the initially determined size and that are from the
	 *   same shm segment from which we determined the size.

	 * it's called with invalid parameters or if it's called to unmap
	 * a part of a vma. Both calls in this function are for full vmas,
	 * the parameters are directly copied from the vma itself and always
